    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      At MEL Labs, we help homebrewers get the most out of their water.
      From testing for chloride, sulfates, alkalinity, and hardness
      to building custom treatment packets, we make water chemistry simple.

    <h2>Why Water Testing?</h2>
    <p>
      The right mineral balance drives mash efficiency, yeast health,
      and beer flavor. We test for all the important brewing ions
      and provide results designed to improve your brewing consistency.
